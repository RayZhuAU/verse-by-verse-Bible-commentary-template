This repository is a template intended for writing a verse by verse Bible commentary. The template includes a folder for each book of the Bible, with subfolders for chapters, and markdown files for verses. 

I recommend using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as the text editor. This allows for additional functionality such as linking to other verses.

This template was created using `generator.py` which adapts https://github.com/aruljohn/Bible-kjv to create files. Omitted verses were subsequently removed.[^1]

## How to Use

1. Fork or download this repository.
2. Write your commentary in the respective markdown file for the verse you are commentating on. e.g. The file for Luke 4:21 would be `Luke/4/21.md`
3. If using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), you can link to other verse files e.g. [[Isaiah/61/1]]

    a. I recommend installing the `Backlinks` and `Outgoing links` plugins
